### Combinators
A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
There are four different combinators in CSS:
1. descendant selector (space)
2. child selector (>)
3. adjacent sibling selector (+)
4. general sibling selector (~)

::: code-tabs
@tab descendant selector
``` css
```
@tab child selector
``` css
```
@tab adjacent sibling selector
``` css
```
@tab general sibling selector
``` css
```

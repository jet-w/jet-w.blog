### Project – from the course outline
The project will develop your research skills, and the <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">presentation</span> help prepare you for the necessary part of future study and career, that of presenting your work in public. The presentation will be in the week of <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">October 15, October 22</span>, with the report <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">due on November 2</span>. Note that external students can negotiate about the presentation and mode. I will give suggestions on topics for the project. They are extensions or applications of the work we have done in workshops and practicals.

You will find material on the topic, either from the reference books, or in other books or research articles. Write it up in a form that will be <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">understandable to the other students</span> and <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">include a working example</span>. This will make setting up the presentation easier, as it should be an opportunity for the other students to learn about the topic.

### Form
Without forcing you into following a recipe, I <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">suggest the following parts</span> should be present, but you might favour another style:

1. Since this is a report on a study topic, it needs <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">a good introductory section</span>, giving the rationale behind why a student at this level would benefit from knowledge of this topic. So this is the motivation for study, and it should contain some short references, perhaps taken from your literature review, if on the same topic.
2. <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">What the method of analysis entails</span> – this is obviously flexible in presentation, and some will do this part many in mathematical form and others in a more descriptive mode.
3. <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">Examples of usage</span> – one or more with discussion on whether the
descriptions that are given are complete or are lacking in some way.
4. <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">Discussion</span> of what can be improved or where else the methods can be applied.
5. <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span> – including what you personally have got from the investigation.

### [Practice 1](/unisa/2023SP5/AdvancedAnalyticTechniques1/LinearRegressionwithExcel#excel-linear-regression)
Practice 1 is an example of linear regression. This means we could use some method to imitate the trend of data, then could use the trend to predict the future potential value.

### [Practice 2](/unisa/2023SP5/AdvancedAnalyticTechniques1/LinearRegressionwithExcel#excel-solver)
Practice 2 is an example of data optimization. The first thing for this kind of task is to define the target. In this case, the target is to get the minimum value of the optimization cell. The future task may be to maximize the target or approaches a specified value.

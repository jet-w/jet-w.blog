## 1 Principles of statistical forecasting
* The main item refers not only to forecasting but any type of statistical modelling.
* It is that one builds the model one part (usually the majority) of the data, and then tests the results on the remainder.
* These sets are termed the Training and Testing sets.
* In standard statistical modelling, often the sets are sampled from the data at random.
* In time series forecasting, this is not possible, as the model building set has to have consecutive data, as does the testing set.
* This is further complicated with data that includes seasonality, as at least the training set has to contain multiples of the fundamental period.
* For instance, for hourly solar radiation, the training set would comprise a number of years. We also have to cater for leap years in some way. The easiest way is to delete Feb 29.

## 2 Example - Lake Huron
* In keeping with the idea of training and testing sets, I took the first 75 years as the training set, reserving 22 years for testing.
* I fitted a line through those 75 data points.
* I then took the residuals of that fit, and developed an $AR(2)$ model for them.
* Let $L(t)$ be the level of the lake, and $f(t)$ be the linear fit.
* Then $r(t) = L(t) − f(t)$ will be the residuals.
The models are

$f(t) = 10.64 − 0.041t$
$r(t) = 0.962r(t − 1) − 0.318r(t − 2)$
$L(t) = 10.64 − 0.41t + 0.962r(t − 1) − 0.318r(t − 2)$

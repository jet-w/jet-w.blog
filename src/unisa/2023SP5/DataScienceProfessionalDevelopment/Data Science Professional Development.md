### Aquaculture Project
::: justify
Aquaculture farmers observe a wide range of survival rate in their culture per harvest cycle due to various reasons. Therefore, there is a need to explore modelling techniques to help guide farming techniques in ensuring a high survival in their culture. This is an industry project using confidential data from an aquaculture farm.

The aims of the project are to:

1. Identify statistically significant variables associated with a high survival rate (>80%)
2. Test and compare regression techniques to forecast harvest yield

The task will involve, but will not be limited to: literature review, data cleaning, data analysis, modelling, calibration, testing, and reporting.

## What's text mining
Text mining refers to the process of extracting interesting and non-trivial information and knowledge from unstructured text

## Text mining applications
1. Spam filtering
2. Creating suggestion and recommendations (like amazon)
3. [Monitoring public opinions (Obama election campaign)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZOfnFCMHTM) 

## Topic modelling
Aim of Topic Models: 
- Large unstructured collection of document
- Discover set of topics that generated the documents
- Annotate documents with topics

- Each document is a distribution of topics (different colors)
- Each topic is a distribution of words

In reality, we only observe the documents
Our goal is to infer the underlying topic structure

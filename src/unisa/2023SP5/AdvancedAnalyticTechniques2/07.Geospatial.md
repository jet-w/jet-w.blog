## Geospatial questions
| Spatial Question | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Location<br>(identify)| **What exist at specific location?**<br>What object is located at 49N 123W? |
| Condition<br>(search)| **Where can you find specific conditions?** <br> where do low income residents live?|
| Trends<br>(overlay analysis)| **What has changed over time?**<br>What is the change in green area size from 2000?|
| Routing<br>(network analysis)| **Which is the best way to travel?**<br>How can I reach a destination in the least time? |
| Patterns<br>(Query analysis)| **How are object distributed in geographic space?**<br>Does salmon streams affect bear presence?|
| Modeling<br>(building spatial models)| **How would conditions change in the future?**<br>What areas will be floored by 1m sea level rise?|

## Spatial Queries
* Spatial Range Queries
    - Find all cities within 50 miles of Paris
    - Query has associated region (location, boundary)
    - Answer includes overlapping or contained data regions
* Nearest-Neighbor Queries
    - Find the 10 cities nearest to Paris
    - Results must be ordered by proximity
* Spatial Join Queries
    - Find all cities near a lake
    - Join condition involves regions and proximity.

## Spatial Data Mining
***Spatial Data Mining:*** the extraction of spatial patterns from both spatial and aspatial data, possibly stored in a spatial database
***Spatial Pattern:*** a pattern showing the interaction of two or more spatial objects or space-depending attributes according to a particular spacing or set of arrangements

### Families of Spatial Data Mining Patterns
* Hot Spot: 
    - Which locations are unusual or share commonalities?
    ::: info
    K-Means cannot work. <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">[DBScan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jl9KkmgDIw)</span> works.
    :::
* Spatial Interactions
    - Co-location objects
    - Which subset of spatial phenomena interact?
    ::: info
    Association rules cannot work. <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Spatial Association Rule</span> (Han, 1995) works.
    :::

    #### Spatial Association Rule (Han, 1995)
    ![Alt text](/data/unisa/AdvancedAnalytic2/week11/SpatialAssociationRule.png)
    **Input:** Feature A, B, C
    **Instances:** A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2
    1. Create transactions by reference feature, e.g. C
    	(C1, B1)
    	(C2, B2)
    2. Support (A, B) = 0
         Support(B, C)= 2/2 = 1
    3. Output = (B, C)

    #### Spatial Colocation
    ![Alt text](/data/unisa/AdvancedAnalytic2/week11/SpatialColocation.png)
    Feature: A, B, C
    Feature Instances: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2
    Feature subsets: (A, B), (A, C), (B, C), (A, B, C)
    1. Participation ratio(Pr):
        Pr(A, (A, B))= fraction of A instances neighbouring feature {B} = 2/2 = 1
        Pr(B, (A, B)) = ½
    2. Participation index (A, B) = pi(A, B) = min{pr(A, (A,B)), pr(B, (A,B)) = min {1, ½} = ½
        Pi(B, C) = min{pr(B, (B,C)), pr(C, (B,C))} = min {1,1,}=1
    3. Output: (A, B), (B,C)

* Location Prediction
    - Where will a phenomenon occur?
    ::: info
    Regression cannot work

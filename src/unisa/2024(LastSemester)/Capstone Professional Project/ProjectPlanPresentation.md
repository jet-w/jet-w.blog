Good morning, professors, I'm very super pleased to present our team's project plan.
The plan comprises 8 sections like the items listed in the slides. Each section focus on different perspective of the plan. I will describe each of them.

## Section 1
The first part is `Project Background and Description`. This section focus on answering several questions related with our plan, which will clarify the key points of the project.

These questions are advanced step by step based on the analysis of the project step by step.

* The first question is `"What the subject are we working on?â€‹"` in other words the question could also be `"what's the main task of the project?"`

The answer is LoD Analysis for BIM data cooperate with John Boland.

---

We can extract two key points from the answer, which are BIM, LoD.

The following two questions are what are them?
The fullname of BIM is Building Information Modeling, which is a digital representation of physical and functional characteristics of a facility. Simple words it's using a 3D model come up with metadata to represent infrastructure.

For LoD, we need to clarify two questions, first is LoD, another one is LoD analysis.
The fullname of LoD is Level of Development or Level of Details. It defines the level of a 3D model. Each 3D model development need to follow some spec defined by the specification organization BIM Forum. 

LoD analysis is to identify the Level of model based the specification files. The process can be broken down into two steps.
Step 1: Identify the spec from the specification file for a 3D model.
Step 2: Identify the level of the 3D model based on the level requirements.

---

The current approach taken by them is to do all the steps manually. It can lead to human error and also it's inefficient.

What we need to do is construct a automatice process to overcome the drawbacks of the manual approach.

---

We split the whole project into 3 modules, which are data preprocessing, LoD analysis and UI parts.

* The data preprocessing mainly focus on converting the specification data to a structured data.
* The LoD analysis is find a pattern to map an object to a specified LoD.
* The UI part is to integrate all other parts as the final visualization, it will be easier to use for end user.

---

Finally, it's obviously that the deliverables should include the structured data, Mapping patttern, and the UI.


## Section 2
The next section is Project Scope. The section includes two parts, which are inclusions and exclusions. 

The inclusions are the tasks has been broken down that we need to do during the following weeks. The exclusions are the tasks that we does not to do.

## Section 3
The third section is Risks that we perhaps will come across. All the risks are mainly about the techniques difficulties. After the analysis of our team, we got 7 risks, 2 high level, 3 midlle level and 2 low level.

## Section 4
The fourth section is the budget, this is a student team there is no real cost, we calculate using the time consuming to get the budget. The team time consuming during the 13 weeks is about 1040 hours.


## Section 5
The fifth section is roles and responsibilities, this section includes 3 parts, which are team members responsiblities, communications plan and project stakeholders.

My responsibilities will focus on the spec preprocessing and LoD analysis.

This table lists our communication plan. This table lists all the project stakeholders.

## Section 6

The sixth section include the deliverables and evaluation criteria.
The deliverables comprise
1. Final Report 
2. Packaging solution
3. Presentation

The evaluation criteria is some criterias that we need to use to evaluate our final deliverables.

## Section 7
The seventh section is the implementation plan.
We defined 7 phase to implement the project, all the items are listed in the slide.
1. Initiation phase, is to finish the project plan.
2. Research Phase is to do literature review to find some available methods for LoD analysis.
3. Data Collection and preprocessing phase focus on preprocess the data.
Phase 4 and 5 focus how to map the model to a LoD.
Phase 6 focus on implementing the UI parts.
The final parts will finetuning work and documents work.

## Section 8
The final section define the timeline for each phase.
Such as, phase 1 & 2 take 1 week each; phase 3 takes 3 weeks, etc.

It's all my presentation. Thanks very much.

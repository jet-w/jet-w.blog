## 1. Project Plan

* This is a <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">group assessment</span>.
* Ensure the focus is on the <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">entire project</span> and not on the project plan itself.
* Executive summary should focus on <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">what will be delivered</span>.
* Scope should <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">explicitly describe any elements that will be excluded</span>.
* Identify risks specific to your project.
* Budget should <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">quantify time and effort</span>.
* Communications plan should <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">cover all involved stakeholders</span>.
* Document perspectives of all relevant stakeholders.
* Final <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">deliverables</span> must be <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">specified clearlyK</span> and must be <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">agreed to by the client</span>.
* Plan must <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">include project evaluation criteria</span> that can be used to measure the level of success the project achieves (from the client’s perspective).
* <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">A Gantt chart</span> (or equiv. for other PM methodologies) should be used to <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">illustrate the project schedule with important milestones and dependencies</span>.
* The word limit for this assessment is 3,500 words.


## 2. Project plan presentation

* This is an <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">*individual*</span> assessment
    * Students must individually prepare their presentations (based on the group’s project plan), supported by a suitable slide deck produced by the individual student.
* Prepare a presentation <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">outlining the key components</span> of each section of the <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">project plan</span>.
    * <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">Every section</span> of the project plan (except the executive summary) must be covered in the presentation.
    * You need to <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">focus on the most important elements</span> as your time is limited.
* Each member of your group will be required to present and justify every section of the project plan individually.
    * You should develop your presentation on the basis that the markers have not yet read your project plan document.
* This means that every group member needs to be cognisant of and committed to the contents of the project plan.
* The <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">scheduled time-slot</span> for each student is <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">10 minutes</span> in duration with <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">8 minutes for presenting</span> and <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">2 minutes for questions</span>.
    * Please rehearse your presentation and ensure that you meet the specified time limit.
* Please submit your slide deck via Learnonline by the deadline specified in the Course Outline.

::: tip
* Your slides should <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">not include large bodies of text</span> copied directly from the plan.
    * Instead focus on <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">highlighting only the key points in dot point form</span>.
* <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">Avoid looking at the slides</span> or notes when presenting.
    * Instead make eye contact with the audience.
* <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">Ensure that the markers have a broad understanding of your project’s objective early in the presentation</span>.
    * Remember that we won’t be as familiar with your project as you are.
* Proof reading!
    * Integral for both the slides and any documentation your produce.

## 3. Presentation Tips

### 3.1 Preparation
* Decide on <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">appropriate language</span> to use; link words to show connections between main points or ideas.
* Use <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">key words several times to emphasise their importance</span>.

### 3.2 Visual aids
* You are required to present using a visual aid (your slide deck):
    > Remember that the slides are for <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">support only</span> and should not be the main focus of the presentation. You are the main focus.
* Slides support your presentation by:
    > * Providing an <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">outline of the presentation</span> (key terms/ideas);
    > * <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">Illustrating key points</span> with images, diagrammes, tables or graphs;
    > * Helping the audience to follow your presentation; and
    > * Keeping you on task (and on time).

### 3.3 Practising
* Practise, practise and practise again. This helps you overcome any nervousness and makes you more confident with the content and the delivery.
* You need to practise what you will say (content) as well as how you will say it (delivery).

#### 3.3.1 Content
* Develop your <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">first set of notes</span> and be ready to adapt them.
* Use cue cards with <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">bullet points</span> and write <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">key words, ideas and phrases</span> rather than sentences. Optimally, you will speak without cue cards on the day of the presentation.
* Practise out loud from your cue cards so you are able to talk about the information in various ways.
* Be sure to state clearly what the purpose of the presentation is in
the introduction.

#### 3.3.2 Delivery
* <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">Time the presentation</span> and modify it if needed. This will help you to avoid being rushed.
* Focus on <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">standing up straight</span>, using <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">appropriate gestures</span> and <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">looking at your audience</span>.
* Practise with an audience or in front of a mirror so you are aware of how you present yourself.
* Be sure to <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">face your audience</span> and <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">engage them with eye contact</span>.
* Practise projecting your voice so the audience can hear you easily.
* Use your voice by changing volume and pitch to add emphasis to important points.
* <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">Use pauses</span> to show that you are moving on to a new point.
* Record you voice to hear how you sound.

#### 3.3.3 Questions
* <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">Anticipate any questions</span> that might be asked and <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">consider possible responses</span>.
* Be <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">clear about your knowledge</span> and what is outside the scope of your presentation.

I need your help with one of the student research projects, while we're waiting for further input on the Human Systems work.


What I need to do is to send a message to openAI API. OpenAI API should **run the same prompt 5 times** (like bootstrapping) and **return a file** with [results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1weID-psaFIfgSKSk4x-FygbGgvidIY4QoN2uARZ1Hsk/edit?usp=sharing) for each run

I want to send this:
`The methods I employed to compare the articles involved reading each one and making a list of its main themes. I then reread the two articles side by side, nothing their similarities and differences.`

[This is Prompt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JC6bhbpqn99OJf7GBYvlIcaLD5bdBTI108NnO2dm1qc/edit?usp=sharing)

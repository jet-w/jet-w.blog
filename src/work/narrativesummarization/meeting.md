***From Ben***
* However, he emphasised a shift in focus towards the tool itself rather than the UI. Essentially, he is keen on delving into the backend aspects.

* The directive is to enhance the performance of the configuration, transforming it into a more user-friendly product for customers.
 
* Currently, Mirko has access to the outcome but not the input file. To improve user experience, we're looking into providing a download link for all input and sample data instead of relying on email tracking.

* Considering the diverse preferences of customers in using the tool and managing data, we aim to strike a balance between private and open resources, drawing inspiration from platforms like OpenAI and Lama.

* We are in the process of documenting the configuration and plan to share it by early next week.

***From Somaniya***
* Giving the download link for data files on the UI
* Actual configuration of what’s going on behind the scene  how did we achieve ranking, summarisation and configuration. ( mostly about the models and algorithm, he asked to not include web/UI/web service details on documentation)
* Explained how our system supports both private and public models

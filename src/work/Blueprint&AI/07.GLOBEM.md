* **INS-W_4 (2021)** - 195 participants

### Data Type 
Each datasets consist of three parts:
1. Feature Data, 
2. Survey Data, 
    a. **Pre/Post Surveys**: collected at the start/end of the study
    b. **EMA Surveys**: collectedly regualrly during the study
3. Participant Info Data

### Behaivor Feature Data

## Data Structure
Each dataset is a **folder** and has its unique name, and every dataset has **three folders**:
* `SurveyData`: a list of files containing participants' survey responses, including `pre/post` long surveys and weekly short `EMA` surveys.
* `FeatureData`: <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">behavior feature vectors</span> from all data types, using `RAPIDS` as the feature extraction tool.
* `ParticipantInfoData`: some additional information about participants, e.g., device platform (iOS or Android).

## Survey Data

### File Instructions
The SurveyData folder contains five files, all indexed by pid and date:
* `pre.csv`: The file contains **all questionnaires** that participants filled in right **before the start of the data collection study (thus pre-study)**.
* `post.csv`: The file contains **all questionnaires** that participants filled in right **after the end of the data collection study (thus post-study)**.
* `ema.csv`: The file contains all **EMA surveys** that participants filled in **during the study**. Some EMAs were delivered on Wednesdays, while some were delivered on Sundays.

Our current benchmark takes depression detection as the main task. Thus we also prepare the following two files. We envision future work can be extended to other modeling targets as well.

* `dep_weekly.csv`: The specific file for **depression labels (column dep)** ***<span style="color:orange">combining</span> post and EMA surveys.***
* `dep_endterm.csv`: The specific file for **depression labels (column dep)** ***<span style="color:orange">only</span> in post surveys***. Some prior depression detection tasks focus on end-of-term depression prediction.

::: info
**PS:** Due to the design iteration, some questionnaires are not available in all studies. Moreover, some questionnaires have different versions across years. We clarify them using column names. For example, `INS-W_2` only has `CESD_9items_POST`, while others have `CESD_10items_POST`. `CESD_9items_POST` is also calculated in other datasets to make the modeling target comparable across datasets.

### Features
::: tabs
@tab Location
|Feature Name | Unit | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
|hometime | minutes | Time at home. Time spent at home in minutes. Home is the most visited significant location between 8 pm and 8 am, including any pauses within a 200-meter radius. |
|disttravelled | meters | Total distance traveled over a day (flights). |
|rog | meters | The Radius of Gyration (rog) is a measure in meters of the area covered by a person over a day. A centroid is calculated for all the places (pauses) visited during a day, and a weighted distance between all the places and that centroid is computed. The weights are proportional to the time spent in each place. |
|maxdiam | meters | The maximum diameter is the largest distance between any two pauses. |
|maxhomedist | meters | The maximum distance from home in meters. |
|siglocsvisited | locations | The number of significant locations visited during the day. Significant locations are computed using k-means clustering over pauses found in the whole monitoring period. The number of clusters is found iterating k from 1 to 200 stopping until the centroids of two significant locations are within 400 meters of one another. |
|avgflightlen | meters | Mean length of all flights. |
|stdflightlen | meters | Standard deviation of the length of all flights. |
|avgflightdur | seconds | Mean duration of all flights. |
|stdflightdur | seconds | The standard deviation of the duration of all flights. |
|probpause | - | The fraction of a day spent in a pause (as opposed to a flight). |
|siglocentropy | nats | Shannon’s entropy measurement is based on the proportion of time spent at each significant location visited during a day. |
|circdnrtn | - | A continuous metric quantifying a person’s circadian routine that can take any value between 0 and 1, where 0 represents a daily routine completely different from any other sensed days and 1 a routine the same as every other sensed day. |
|wkenddayrtn | - | Same as circdnrtn but computed separately for weekends and weekdays. |
|locationvariance | meters2 | The sum of the variances of the latitude and longitude columns. |

|timeattop3location | minutes | Time spent at the 3rd most significant location. |
|movingtostaticratio | - | Ratio between stationary time and total location sensed time. A lat/long coordinate pair is labeled as stationary if its speed (distance/time) to the next coordinate pair is less than 1km/hr. A higher value represents a more stationary routine. |
|outlierstimepercent | - | Ratio between the time spent in non-significant clusters divided by the time spent in all clusters (stationary time. Only stationary samples are clustered). A higher value represents more time spent in non-significant clusters. |
|maxlengthstayatclusters | minutes | Maximum time spent in a cluster (significant location). |
|minlengthstayatclusters | minutes | Minimum time spent in a cluster (significant location). |
|avglengthstayatclusters | minutes | Average time spent in a cluster (significant location). |
|stdlengthstayatclusters | minutes | Standard deviation of time spent in a cluster (significant location). |
|locationentropy | nats | Shannon Entropy computed over the row count of each cluster (significant location), it is higher the more rows belong to a cluster (i.e., the more time a participant spent at a significant location). |
|normalizedlocationentropy | nats | Shannon Entropy computed over the row count of each cluster (significant location) divided by the number of clusters; it is higher the more rows belong to a cluster (i.e., the more time a participant spent at a significant location). |
|timeathome | minutes | Time spent at home. |
|timeat[PLACE] | minutes | Time spent at [PLACE], which can be living, exercise, study, greens. |

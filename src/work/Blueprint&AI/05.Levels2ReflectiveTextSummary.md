| ID |  Thought |  Effect | Code |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | Using the definition to do directly | Result is not good | [Code on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EPxMGd9swV3lnJuVThK3cAepl6zrlX0w?usp=sharing)<br/> <br/>[More details](05.Levels2ReflectiveText)|
| 2 | Decompose the level definition, then to find the best match as the result based on the definition of levels and the question. <br/> Using lots of match methods to finetune.| Result is not good | [Code on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZIb76fPZZvqIpcJeZG81reGh9ftARau9?usp=sharing)<br/> <br/>[More details](05.Levels2ReflectiveText)|
| 3 | Finetune the model on OpenAI, and then to identify the level based on level definition and question<br/> Using three approaches to sample data for training, <br/> 1. Sample data from the shifting level dataset (Grouped sampling from each level randomly) <br/> 2. Sample data from overall dataset automatically (Grouped sampling from each level randomly) <br/> 3. Group sample data from all data randomly.  | Result is still not good enough | [Code on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Sx37U_Yp_BBORjVw8o2vr3ETzc6gDD2-?usp=sharing)|
| 4 | Using the GPT to summarize the definition for levels, then using the new definitions to create new prompt for getting result | Done | [Code on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jMRCks-97kDnceDAKg1Cjz-Wo7pG6q0j?usp=sharing)|
| 4 | Summarize the definition & finetuning groups data | Under the way | [Code on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Yumr8PVfMXH9P_ty5BcDwskDMP4tEtrm?usp=sharing)|

Prompt finetuning over many times.

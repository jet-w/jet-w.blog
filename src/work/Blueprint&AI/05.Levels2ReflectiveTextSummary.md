| 1 | Using the definition to do directly | Result is not good |
| 2 | Decompose the level definition, then to find the best match as the result based on the definition of levels and the question. <br/> Using lots of match methods to finetune.| Result is not good |
| 3 | Finetune the model on OpenAI, and then to identify the level based on level definition and question<br/> Using three approaches to sample data for training, <br/> 1. Sample data from the shifting level dataset (Grouped sampling from each level randomly) <br/> 2. Sample data from overall dataset automatically (Grouped sampling from each level randomly) <br/> 3. Group sample data from all data randomly.  | Result is still not good enough |
| 4 | Using the GPT to summarize the definition for levels, then using the new definitions to create new prompt for getting result | On the way |

Prompt finetuning over many times.

## Dataset 
The dataset is [Manuallycoded.Answers](/data/HS/data/Manuallycoded.Answers.csv)

There are 6 columns with this dataset, which are `module_id`, `student_id`, `Answers`, `Question`, `Group`, `Final` like the picture below.
![Snap for datasets](/data/HS/data/dataset.png)

1. `module_id`: relative to question.
2. `student_id`: student id
3. `Answers`: The answer for the relative question, the data need to be classified.
4. `Question`: The question for answer.
5. `Group`: relative to question.
6. `Final`: represent the levels, from 1 to 4 correspond to [`No-Reflection`, `Understanding`, `Simple Reflection`, `Critical Reflection`]

## Levels definition

1. **No-Reflection**: Professionals do not indicate any significant reflective thought processes and mainly mirror the words and phrases from the question or give a general comment.
2. **Understanding**: Professionals indicate an understanding of concepts or topics from demonstrating a practical application of theory, yet lack specific details of professional or real-life experiences.
3. **Simple Reflection**: Professionals indicate an understanding of the theory in unison with examples of practical application, yet only provide a vague explanation of future actions or outcomes. They do not provide concrete examples of action or application for the future.
4. **Critical Reflection**: Besides relating the theory with examples from real-life experiences, professionals indicate what they are likely to do in the future or what they need to work on. In some cases, professionals might also reflect a change in their perspective.

## Tasks
Using openai to **classify** the **answers** to a specified level based on the level definitions and question.

***Parameters for openai***
1. model: `gpt-4-0314`
2. others: default values

If we regard `final` column as a baseline. The difference is the result from openai minus baseline. If the result is 0, it means the result remains the same with the same with baseline. If the result is a positive value, it means the openai gives a higher level than baseline; else if the result is a negative value, it means the openai gives a lower level than baseline.

According to the results above, the level from openai normally give a higher level than baseline. The difference is mostly 1.

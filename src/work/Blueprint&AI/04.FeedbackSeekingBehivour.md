In future studies, directly measuring learners’ perceptions of these costs and values could develop our understanding of the mechanisms mediating the relationship between belief/motive systems and FSB.

## Questions

**The goal:**: Tracking whether a student is reaching out for feedback. For example, we analyse interactions with Dialogic Agent or provide an option in LMS "I need feedback".

**Direction:** <span style="color:orange">According to the goal, we need to detect the intention/future behaviours of the student based on his/her past behaviours.</span>
